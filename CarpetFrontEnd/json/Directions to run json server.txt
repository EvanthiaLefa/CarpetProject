1. Install Node.js on your computer.
2.Open a terminal and go to the directory where the db.json is located.
3. Install the required dependencies by running the command    "npm install"    in the terminal. This will download and install the json-server package and any other dependencies listed in the package.json file.
4. Run the command    "npx json-server -w db.json -p 3004"    in the terminal to start the JSON server. This assumes that your database file is named "db.json" and that the server should listen on port 3004.
